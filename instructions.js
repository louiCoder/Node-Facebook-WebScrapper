 * All tasks/issues before started are in the "Todo" column and should be moved to the "In progress tab" when the person has
 * started working on it. This can be done by dragging the task between columns.
 * 
 * Anyone can also create a new issue/task when they feel that the it deserves to be on the project. This can be done by;
 * 1. clicking on the "Issues" tab on the project repo 
 * 2. Add short title and detailed information on what the task should cover
 * 3. You can add assignee or leave it for someone to pick up
 * 4. Add a corresponding label for the issue/task
 * 5. Assign it to the corresponding project and in this case "Node Webscrapper"
